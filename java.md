# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up

#### Your answer:  
1:  header of the method
2:  return value type declaration
3:  name of method
4:  input parameter type declaration
5:  input parameter name, value passed to the method
6:  return value
7:  body of the method
8:  return statement + return value  

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
A constructor is very similar to a method and it's always called when we want to create a new instance of a certain object. The difference between a constructor and a "normal" method is, that while the method has a return type, the constructor does not. The name of the constructor must be exactly the same as the name of the class.
